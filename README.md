A PDF generator tool for Figaro

Created by James Talbot and Hamish Dickson

## Suggestions

For suggestions please raise an issue or contact Hamish

## Prerequisites
* Python 2.7
* Please create configuration file in Figdocs/configuration/testconfig.json

For the webapp
* node.js (http://nodejs.org/)
* express (npm install express)

## Note on the webapp

For now at least we're going to run a node.js webapp - this may change in the near future to a Django app

We've included the modules required to run the webapp as a temp solution, if you would like to update the modules, please cd to Figdoc/webapp/app and call npm update, this will update the modules from package.json
